! [Database prototype](images/dbV1.png)

Worked on a prototype for the database layout, where there are supercategories that store categories that store tasks that store subtasks.\
Both types of category hold a name and id.\
Tasks hold a name and description and a completion percentage
Subtasks hold a task name, optional image blob, and a deadline datetime.

! [Site flowchart prototype](images/flowV1.png)

Worked on a prototype for the site flowchart layout. I want the website to seem like it only has a single page, so we start on the general supercategory which displays all the categories and descendant tasks for that supercategory. Forms to create supercategories, categories, tasks, and subtasks will be done with iframes that display above the supercategory page. Delete and reorder requests will be handled by a page that redirects when done, or an invisible iframe that closes when done. This gives us a single page website.  
My current thinking is that supercategories will be displayed vertically on the left sidebar, categories will be displayed horizontally in the main portion of the page, and tasks will be displayed under the category. Clicking on a task will bring up an iframe which lists all the subtasks for a task.
