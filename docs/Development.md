! [Database prototype](images/dbV1.png)

Worked on a prototype for the database layout, where there are supercategories that store categories that store tasks that store subtasks.\
Both types of category hold a name and id.\
Tasks hold a name and description and a completion percentage
Subtasks hold a task name, optional image blob, and a deadline datetime.
