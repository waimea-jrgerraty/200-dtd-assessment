![Database prototype](images/dbV1.png)

Worked on a prototype for the database layout, where there are supercategories that store categories that store tasks that store subtasks.\
Both types of category hold a name and id.\
Tasks hold a name and description and a completion percentage
Subtasks hold a task name, optional image blob, and a deadline datetime.

Worked on a prototype for the site flowchart layout. I want the website to seem like it only has a single page, so we start on the general supercategory which displays all the categories and descendant tasks for that supercategory. Forms to create supercategories, categories, tasks, and subtasks will be done with iframes that display above the supercategory page. Delete and reorder requests will be handled by a page that redirects when done, or an invisible iframe that closes when done. This gives us a single page website.  
My current thinking is that supercategories will be displayed vertically on the left sidebar, categories will be displayed horizontally in the main portion of the page, and tasks will be displayed under the category. Clicking on a task will bring up an iframe which lists all the subtasks for a task.

![Database edits](images/dbV2.png)

I have made some changes to the database by adding the order keys to tasks as they need to be ordered within the task list for categories. Subtasks can be ordered by their id though I will ask my end users if they would really like to order subtasks as well. Also added a completed value to the table so that you can actually mark a subtask as done.

Have gotten my [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/proto/pfaXQRa3RBhN2Mvv3dRuT0/Game-Development-Manager---v0.0.1?node-id=1-2&t=Gp4fkgIBN0A21vR9-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2) into a state where I would like feedback on it before trying to get it too detailed, so I will show the prototype to my end users. I need to get some options for the colour theme that satisfies everyone's needs, especially for my end user with colour blindness.  
The subtask menu is still a work in progress.
