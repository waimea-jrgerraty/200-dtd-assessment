## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

It is too hard to manage workflow in Game Development in a small team where each member has specialised roles using existing tooling. Current tools focus on general usage for any end user, which does not translate well to our team. It is too hard to split different tasks into different teams using singular categories and as a result, we find ourselves moving away from such tools, to the detriment of our workflow.

### End-User Requirements

The End-Users are the other people TODO

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.
