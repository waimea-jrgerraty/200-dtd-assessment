# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Game Development Manager Website**

Project Author: **James Gerraty**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

It is too hard to manage workflow in Game Development in a small team where each member has specialised roles using existing tooling. Current tools focus on general usage for any end user, which does not translate well to our team. It is too hard to split different tasks into different teams using singular categories and as a result, we find ourselves moving away from such tools, to the detriment of our workflow.

### End-User Requirements

The End-Users are the other people in my small game development studio. Communications between our roles has been problematic in the past so sharing tasks with the rest of the team needs to be easy. We need specialised sections for programming, 3d design, animation, and writing. One of our end users speaks korean as his first language, so we need translations for the site interface.

### Proposed Solution

The site will let you organize tasks into super-categories, which will be editable but as a basic idea would be split up as General, Animation, 3D, Writing, Programming. Inside a super-category will be a collection of creatable, editable, and moveable categories, which you can insert tasks into. A task has a basic description and contains sub-tasks which will be the actual things you are checking off. Users will be able to archive and delete cards they have completed.

By organising the website like this, it allows each part of the game development pipeline to remain separated into its specific section, while also allowing users to get quick feedback on a task through an alert system despite each section being split up like this.

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

Usability relates to how easy an interface is to use for the end-users. Interfaces should follow common usability heuristics and make intuitive sense. An interface should be usable to the end user without any help or assistance, and ensure it is quick and simple to use the website for their needs. Neilsen's 10 usability heuristics are the following:

    Visibility of system status - Users are informed about what is currently happening. Feedback needs to be given to know the interface is performing an action, through status messages and progress bars.
    
    Match between system and the real world - Words, images and concepts should be familiar to the user, and reflect real world experiences, for example, a shopping website will use a trolley icon for your cart as it communicates what its function is without the user having to check it themselves.
    
    User control and freedom - Users need to have control over the interface, they should be able to cancel or undo actions to exit unwanted states.
    Consistency and standards - The UI of an interface should follow the conventions of other similar interfaces, as the user will already be familiar with how to navigate it. For a website, placing menus along the top and/or left of the screen and using standard icons (house for home) is best practice.
    
    Error prevention - Prevent users from making errors when possible, for irreversible actions, make the user confirm what they are doing. For forms, include sanity checks so that information entered follows the correct format and is believable.
    
    Recognition rather than recall - Make objects, actions, and options visible and recognisable. Users should not have to remember information from one step to the next.
   
    Flexibility and efficiency of use - New users should be able to easily use the interface, but more experienced users should also be able to speed up their workflow, for example, by learning keybindings for actions rather than navigating menus.
    
    Aesthetic and minimalist design - Keep the interface as simple as possible, and focus on the current user action. only show necessary information at any point and avoid overwhelming the user with pointless information.
    
    Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors - Error messages should be plain and helpful, ideally suggesting a solution to the problem as well.
    
    Help and documentation - Try to create a system that doesn't need documentation, but if needed is easily accessible and easy to understand.


Usability is important to my project as it needs to be easier to use for our needs than competing tools such as trello. By creating a specialised site for my end users I hope to create a fast and effective tool that will aid in our workflow and allow us to get more done as a team. If the site is not easy or intuitive to use then it will go unused and any time migrating current tasks over will have been wasted. Because of this I need to ensure that it fits the needs of all our team members and is still quick and simple to use.

I need to make sure each part of my project follows Neilsen's usability heuristics. TODO
